# Blood Atlas

## Description
Blood is the predominant source for molecular analyses in humans, both in clinical and research settings, and it is the target for many therapeutic strategies, emphasizing the need for comprehensive molecular maps of the cells constituting human blood. Here, we have performed a genome-wide transcriptomic analysis of protein-coding genes in 18 sorted blood immune cell populations to characterize the expression levels of each individual gene across the blood cell types. All data is presented in an interactive, open access Blood Atlas as part of the Human Protein Atlas (https://www.proteinatlas.org/) and is integrated with expression profiles across 37 tissues to provide a new classification of all protein-coding genes. This allows for a genome-wide exploration of the spatial expression profiles across human immune cell populations and all major human tissues and organs.
